Dear Miss Zhong:
    
Thank you! Thank you do not make learning to become crafts, but a kind of joy; Thank you for letting me know their value; Thank you for helping me find their expertise, but let me do things better; Thank you for being one I can never trust people - will be in trouble in their lives to help people.

More than a year, and you spent together the joy of a freshman English time. Thus you own English foundation is bad, so I always studay for examination and learn English, cause I am not interested in English. Later, you say: learn English, more important is the culture behind the English. Let me know, learn English, is to want from a kind of new thinking, to think from different ways of looking at the world, English gave us very powerful tool, exchange ideas, change thinking and so on, these are all I learn English a powerful driving force. And each time you showed us film, not only the classic, but also let us a lot, let us perfect oneself. 

Second, I hang the families. I know that English is not a short time may be successful, so, I insist that self-confidence, I will learn English well, repay the teacher's teaching.
