One
I feel on you hand
No principle
Childlike like

 <!--more-->
 
Refuse 
Accept
It one think
Not one thing

Lightly
At you side
Find original shade
Drop some shadow

Not forget 
Not forgive
Quiet rain of yesternight
Empty chairs at empty tables

Have time
Not youth
Intact oneday
Wish for eye

Miss you
Goofy kid
Feel full 
One day one 

Cloud of the rainbow
God will
Full in time
Don't back


Not said
On that night
No wake up
Sleeping on your side for all time
